                        About me...
                    </h2>
                    <p>My name is <b>Martha Locks</b> and I'm from <b>Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil.</b></p>
                    <p>I'm living here since I was born. I'm married (my husband <a href="https://mlocks.com.br" target="_blank">Juliano Maciel</a> is a Programmer, too 😉) and we have a son called Rafael Locks 😍.</p>
                    <p>I started my career in Web Development doing a technology degree in Systems Analysis and Development (in progress). 
                        Before that, I was a teacher of children in early childhood education. My first degree was in Pedagogy 🎓 in 2006. </p>
                    <p>Since July of 2017, I'm developing <b>Responsive Web Projects</b> or <b>Web Apps</b> using Frontend and Backend Frameworks.</p>
                    <p>The frameworks I'm using are <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://angular.io/" target="_blank">Angular</a>.</p>
